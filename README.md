# Core BHoM_Engine Repo

This repo is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. 
If you are new (_welcome!_  👋 😄)  a great place to start is on [bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz) and reading our [documentation](https://bhom.xyz/documentation), including our [Getting Started Pages](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Basics/Using-the-BHoM/).

This particular repo contains all of the core _engine methods_ that operate on the central object model.

The BHoM Engine is essentially a large list of funtions for processing BHoM objects, extending their capability. With the objects themselves a simple agreed list of properties, the engines are where all the intelligence is stored, capturing and encoding crowd sourced know-how. See [creating new algorithms](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/BHoM_Engine/) for more details.


Along with the rest of the core repositories - [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM), [BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Adapter) and [BHoM_UI](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_UI) – this is the basis on which all of the BHoM Toolkits are built.

## Quick Start 🚀 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).


## Getting Started for Developers 🤖 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! 😄 
Do take a look at our specific wiki pages here: [Getting Started for Developers](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Guides-and-Tutorials/Coding-with-BHoM/).
