# Core BHoM_Engine Repo

This repo is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. 
If you are new (_welcome!_  ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„)  a great place to start is on [bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz) or reading our [wiki here](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki) including pages like the [Structure of the BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Structure-of-the-BHoM) and [Using the BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Using-the-BHoM).

This particular repo contains all of the core _engine methods_ that operate on the central object model.

The BHoM Engine is essentially a large list of funtions for processing BHoM objects, extending their capability. With the objects themselves a simple agreed list of properties, the engines are where all the intelligence is stored, capturing and encoding crowd sourced know-how. See [creating new algorithms](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/BH.Engine-%E2%80%90-Create-New-Algorithms) for more details.


Along with the rest of the core repositories - [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM), [BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Adapter) and [BHoM_UI](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_UI) â€“ this is the basis on which all of the BHoM Toolkits are built.

## Quick Start ðŸš€ 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).


## Getting Started for Developers ðŸ¤– 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! ðŸ˜„ 
Do take a look at our specific wiki pages here: [Getting Started for Developers](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Getting-started-for-developers)
